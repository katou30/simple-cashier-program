# simple-cashier-program
a program that I created to complete midterm exam assignments. 

# This program has several main functions:
1. Displaying a List of Items and Prices. Users can see the available item choices, complete with their prices.
2. Selecting Items Based on Code. By entering the item code, users can determine the items they want to buy.
3. Calculating the Total Price. The program will accumulate the prices of the selected items.
4. Discount Application. If the total shopping price reaches Rp100,000 or more, the program will provide a 10% discount.
